# Werdle

*A Wordle solver*

1. Visit [the static page](https://ringmaster.github.io/werdle/dist/) in your browser.
2. Guess a good first word on Wordle.  I often use "RAISE".
3. For every letter in the correct place, add that letter in the first row in the correct slot.
4. For every letter not in the word, add that letter to the textbox in row 2.
5. For every letter in the wrong place, add that letter to the non-matching place in the third row.  Use the "Add Miss" button to add a new miss row if necessary.
6. Choose the topmost word in the resulting list as your next Wordle guess.
7. Repeat steps 3 through 6 until you guess the correct word.

This tool should be able to guess the correct word in most World puzzles within 3 guesses.  More than 4 guesses is atypical.
